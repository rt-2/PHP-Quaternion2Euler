# PHP-Quaternion2Euler
A function to convert quaternions to Euler angles

When developing my "OpenIV-XML-to-RageMP-JSON-Converter", I noticed I couldn't find any written PHP functions for this task, so when we finally managed to write one, I decided it could be nice to share it.

Big thanks to dav90 from the CodeWalker discord and the [Math discord](https://discord.me/math)
